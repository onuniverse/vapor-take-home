# Hi Universe team

Here's my submission for the vapor take-home project. I was able to complete the Artist Release search endpoint successfully, and _most_ of the Playlist endpoints more or less successfully (add song to playlist works but has issues, delete song from playlist is not implemented but has a commented out block of code where my attempt was). I tried to leave comments where things went astray or where I wasn't able to finish things - the most relevant ones are in the Release model and the PlaylistController. Also, a bunch of files registered as changed, but were not. I think it's a line ending issue.
