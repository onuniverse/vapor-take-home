#  Notes

- Discog's artist release endpoint returns releases with an id and a main release id, but their release endpoint uses the main release id to identify releases, even though the response object that comes back from that release endpoint labels the main release id as simply "id"
- the included postman collection was very useful - it's missing the update playlist call, though
- VAPOR DOCUMENTATION IS EXTREMELY BAD
